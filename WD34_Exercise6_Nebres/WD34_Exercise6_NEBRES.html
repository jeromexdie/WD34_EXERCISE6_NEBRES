        From

          >fine, white sandy beaches to remarkable cliffs and hidden waterfalls,
          Pagudpud remains to be a vivid example of a true tropical paradise of
          Northern Philippines.</span

      <p class="about">
        Pagudpud, a town situated 1 and a half hours north of Laoag City, the
        provincial capital of Ilocos Norte, and about 10 hours by land from the
        Philippine capital Manila, is fast gaining fame in the international
        travel circuit staking its claim amongst the pretenders to the throne of
        having the best Philippine beach which unarguably is perennially held by
        Boracay in Aklan. But Boracay it is not, although it comes pretty close
        when it comes to sand quality, the clarity of its stunningly blue waters
        and the length and width of its beaches (other beaches in the
        Philippines do have white sand, but not as fine nor the beach as long
        nor wide). But whilst Boracay caters to the to the party scene and its
        extensive range of island activities, Pagudpud derives its charm from
        exactly the opposite of that – even on a long weekend, the beaches of
        Maira-ira, Saud and Pansian rarely get the hordes of tourists that
        Boracay, Panglao (Bohol), and Puerto Galera (Oriental Mindoro) due to
        the town’s relative remoteness (although Easter Weekend is an apparent
        exception as told by our Korong-korong driver where the road to
        Maira-ira can get pretty clogged with traffic).

          rolling hills and flat coastal plains.

          The 20,000 people who live in Pagudpud Ilocos Norte and the
          surrounding area generally subsist on rice farming (we have three rice
          fields ourselves), general farming, fishing (the fresh fish and
          lobsters are delicious and cheap here) and more recently tourism. Our
          well known and TripAdvisor award winning boutique hotel and restaurant
          is right near Saud Beach.

            The Ilocano material culture and spirituality can be seen in the
            past - images of Spanish santo (saints), antique but intricate
            wooden furniture and quality local fiber. The native Ilocano is a
            weaver, wood carver and pottery expert. The Ilocano cuisine – ranges
            from the exotic "abu-os" (ant eggs) to vegetable broth "dinengdeng,"
            the sticky "tinubong" to the "poqui-poqui" (eggplant salad).
            Ilocandia is filled with colonial churches, the legacy of Spanish
            Catholicism.

          <p class="pamamanhikan">
            Ilocanos have high respect to their parents, which is absolutely
            evident in their marriage traditions. Before even planning for
            marriage, Ilocano youths seek first the approval of both sets of
            parents. The parents are to decide if they would agree to let their
            child marry or not.

            her parents.

            Bats are the only mammals that are capable of sustained flight
            compared to flying squirrel that can only glide for a short while.
            The bat’s forelimbs are developed as wings. It is believed that bats
            maintain a healthy environment. About 70% of bats are insectivores
            while the rest are frugivores and few are carnivores. Insectivores
            eat about 600 insects a day which the community gets rid of insect
            related diseases such as malaria. They help in the ecological
            balance. They have the role in the pollination of flowers and help
            in the seed dispersal. These are the reasons why they came up with

            abundantly catered for tourism. Several resorts are lined up at this
            beautiful soft white sand beach nestled within a lagoon with azure
            blue waters. Marked by two little islands called Twin Islands, a
            perfect example of a good budget hotel is located at the outer end

          <p>
            Casa Consuelo Resort is a fine option if you'd like to pay a little
            less than some of the bigger resorts at the lagoon. For only 2500
            PHP (USD 47) a night you'll have a nice quiet piece of the Blue

            This is bordered by spectacular multi-coloured corals and iridescent

            with a little privacy. In fact, we had a nice time during our stay
            here in 2013. The beach is lined with over hanging coconut palms,
            creating a scene from a dream. A popular venue for fashion photo

            Bantay Abot caves are located in Sitio Gaoa, Balaoi. It means a sea
            mountain with a hole.
          </p>
          <p>
            The naturally sculpted hole was steadily eroded by waves until it
            was wrecked by an earthquake during the 1980’s. It’s sort of like a
            giant donut! The waves continue to wash through and shape the hole.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also sometimes called the underground sea, as the top of the
            cave is covered by lush green vegetation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside the cave is a church, and once inside you hear the muffled
            echo of waves breaking and also the birds singing as swallows also
            inhabit the cave.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sea shore around the Bantay Abot cave is white sand and shells.
            It’s a great place to just sit and meditate or be close to the sea.
            It is also a great photograph spot for a Bantay Abot Instagram
